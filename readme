Name: Everett Shen
Teammate's name: Trivan Menezes
Assignment Number: 5

My contribution: I worked predominately on fixing the errors from assignment 2
and adapting the code so that the backend was multi-process. 

My teammate's contribution: Trivan worked predominately on making reg.py 
multithreaded and handling thread/process related errors 

Help received:
We did not consult any other people during this assignment.

Information sources:
We consulted the lecture slides and code examples for multi-process and
multi-threaded programming

We also consulted the online Python documentation for information
on helper functions.

Time spent: 4 hours

Assessment of the assignment:
It was surprisingly easier than expected to make our code multi-process
and multi-threaded. This assignment really demonstrated the value of 
making your programs multi-process/threaded. It was also satisfying to 
fix errors that were left over from previous assignments

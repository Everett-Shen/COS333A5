Teammate's name: Everett Shen
Assignment Number: 4

My contribution: I worked predominately on modifying the backend Flask code and inserting the code in the frontend which makes the AJAX calls to the backend. 

My teammate's contribution: Everett worked predominately on modifying the frontend and integrating the Bootstrap styling. Additionally, he wrote much of the error-handling code.

Help received:
We did not consult any other people during this assignment.

Information sources:
We consulted the lecture slides and code examples for client-side programming regarding AJAX calls and Bootstrap integration.

We also consulted the online Python documentation for information
on helper functions.

Time spent: 4 hours

Assessment of the assignment:
It was really satisfying to modify the Registrar application so that its UI is instantly responsive to all user inputs. We learned a lot about integrating AJAX calls on user keystrokes and also setting up a route in the backend to return fragments of data to insert into the frontend. Additionally, the process of using Bootstrap to create responsive UI styling was also satisfying. I imagine these skills will prove to be very useful in real-life projects going forward. Overall, this was a great assignment.

Name: Trivan Menezes
Teammate's name: Everett Shen
Assignment Number: 2

My contribution:
I led the programming effort during the creation of reg.py. I was the
"driver" during this period in our pair-programming setup, and Everett
gave advice about the approach to the code and cases to consider.
One of my largest contributions included implementing the GUI 
according to specifications using PyQt5, and performing client side networking 
and error handling. We both contributed to designing the architecture of the
program and specifications regarding how data should be communicated.

My teammate's contribution:
Everett led the programming effort during the creation of regserver.py and its helper functions.
He was the "driver" in the pair-programming setup during this time, while
I gave advice about the best practices to use and the most appropriate
method of implementing certain features. He handled the server side 
networking and error handling, as well as reading and writing from
the database. We both contributed to designing the architecture of the
program and specifications regarding how data should be communicated.

Help received:
We did not consult any other people during this assignment.

Information sources:
We consulted the lecture slides and code examples for Network
Programming and GUI programming, as well as the PyQt5 docs

We also consulted the online Python documentation for information
on helper functions.

Time spent: 7 hours

Assessment of the assignment:
It was cool to be able to use what we created for assignment 1 as a base
and use what we learned in class to take it to the next level. Our extra
time spent in the first assignment making database functions modular 
really paid off, as it was pretty easy to reuse functions with minimal change.
We were surprised that working with sockets was easier than expected, and 
that it worked rather flawlessly in conjunction with the frontend due to 
separation of concerns.
